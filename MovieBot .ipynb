            "As the last of the humans on Pandora, the paraplegic Marine, named Jake Sully, is tasked with protecting the planet's indigenous alien species, called the Na'vi. However, when Jake discovers that the humans who came before him have been mining Pandora's resources and polluting the planet, he must decide whether to follow the orders and destroy the Na'vi or risk being exiled from the planet and losing the one thing he ever felt whole. With the help of his new Na'vi guide, Neytiri, Jake embarks on a journey to find a way to stop the humans and save Pandora. Along the way, he learns more about himself and the Na'vi's way of life. Will Jake's mission to destroy the Na'vi change his mind, and will he become a hero to both species? Avatar is a visually stunning film that explores themes of love, betrayal, and the importance of protecting the environment.\n",
            "1. Avatar ends on a cliffhanger with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) being shot in the back by his fellow Marine and left for dead. As he lies there, he sees the blue light from the Na'vi ship and hears them speaking to each other in a language he doesn't understand. The camera pans back to reveal a Na'vi soldier, who has taken off his mask, standing over Jake. Suddenly, Jake's body starts to transform, and he becomes one with the Na'vi, joining their fight against the humans.\n",
            "2. Avatar ends with the human colonel (Colin Firth) realizing the true beauty of Pandora and the Na'vi culture. He convinces the other humans to leave the planet and allow the Na'vi to live in peace. However, as Jake and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) bid farewell, Jake turns to the colonel and says, \"I wish you could have seen what I saw.\" The camera pans out to reveal a shot of Pandora, with the Na'vi people and their beautiful world shining in the sun.\n",
            "3. Avatar ends with Jake and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) leading a rebellion against the humans, who have invaded Pandora in an effort to mine the resources from the planet. As they fight, Jake discovers that his own brother was part of the invasion force. Despite this revelation, Jake chooses to fight alongside the Na'vi, and they ultimately defeat the humans, who are forced to leave the planet.\n",
            "4. Avatar ends with Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) returning to Earth as a paraplegic Marine, but with a newfound respect for the Na'vi people and their way of life. As he walks through the city, he sees a Na'vi warrior (Sam Rockwell) standing outside a museum, holding a sign that reads \"Save Pandora.\" Jake approaches him and asks, \"How can I help?\" The Na'vi warrior looks at him with a knowing smile and says, \"By never forgetting where you came from.\"\n",
